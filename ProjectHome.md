Back in January of this year, we at Appiphony launched our new website utilizing Force.com Sites. As part of that project we built a blogging application to manage the publication of our corporate blog and case studies. Having been a longtime fan of Roller, the open source Java based blogging server, we decided that our goal would be to match many of the major features it offered, but make our solution an alternative that ran in the Cloud. Relay is fully customizable and can be skinned to take on whatever appearance you desire. It offers a series of rich features that include **Multi-Blog Support**, **Multiple Profiles/Users**, **Advanced WYSIWYG Editor**, **Captcha** via ReCaptcha, **Email-to-Post**, **RSS Feeds**, **Post Archival**, **Search**
